## ADR 001: JSON schema for validating events

## Context

Either implicit or explicit we always have a _schema_ in our data. In the context of a _unified log_ event, 
we need a way of enforcing some required properties (and data types) on that event (a.k.a schema validation).

We need to find a way of defining the schema for those events that can be used for validation by all parties
(producers, unified log storage, consumers).

## Decision

We will use [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) for defining the shape of an event. We know there are many
alternatives for defining and enforcing a schema e.g. Protol Buffers, Thrift, Apache Avro, but those are binary
serialization format, and we want to produce and consume JSON.

## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

The benefit of using a schema is that all parties producing and/or consuming this data know the shape upfront,
so the validations on that data is not hidden in the implementation

We need to find a way of storing and sharing those schemas, since we don't want to copy some schema
definition a product repository because could get out of sync quite easily.
Perhaps some tool like [iglu](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu/wiki) can solve this issue.
