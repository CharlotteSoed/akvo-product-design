## ADR 002: Raw data reports reimplementation in Clojure

## Context

With recent rapid increase in data collection size we are approaching the limits of what the current raw data reports implementation can handle. The current implementation relies on a legacy rest api where question answers are fetched one-by-one. In addition there is currently no ability to only fetch part of the data for example based on a time range.

## Decision

* Implement raw data reports in Clojure running on akvo-flow-services
* Use the google app engine [RemoteAPI](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/remoteapi) which can fetch data in batches as well as specify filters (for time range queries).
* Enhance the FLOW Dashboard report generation interface with the ability to specify time ranges when generating raw data reports.
* Consider using email to notify the user when a report is ready for download.

## Status

Proposed

## Consequences

We will take what we learn from handling this new scale of data sizes in the continued long term approach to [report generation](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-reporting).
