## ADR 003: Browser-based submission of survey form responses

## Context

In certain cases organisations would like to take advantage of the AkvoFLOW data gathering capabilities but due to their (organistions') nature, they do not require the mobile app to fill out survey forms.  They instead require the possibility to fill out and submit survey forms through a web browser.

The implementation of this feature occurs at a moment in which we are in the process of migrating the entire Akvo FLOW backend functionality away from being hosted on GAE infrastructure.

The requirement of the possibility to fill in and submit responses through a browser-based interface is also applicable beyond AkvoFLOW and is relevant for other products developed by Akvo.

## Decision

* We will avoid as much as possible making any modification to the GAE component and  implement this functionality as a service that interacts with the GAE component.

* We will split the implementation of the functionality into two components, a client and a backend server component.

* The server component will read the XML representation of the form definition (as currently used by the Akvo FLOW mobile app), and expose an API that delivers the form definition in JSON format. 

* The client will read the flow representation from the server API, and render the forms in html.

* The client will store responses locally until submit time. At submit time, the client delivers the responses to the server.

* The server component will receive the responses submitted by the client, transform the responses to the correct format as used by GAE, and use the regular GAE data ingestion process, as used by the device.

## Status

In progress.

## Consequences

* We will create minimal to no code modifications within the GAE component also avoiding the possible need for reimplementation at a later stage.

* Storing the responses locally till submission implies the possibility of data loss in case a browser/computer crashes.
