### Overview
The aim is to provide a tree structure of 'projects groups', in which users can organise their survey and monitoring projects. A survey project only has a single form, while a monitoring project can have multiple forms. In this way, users can organise their projects. The structure will also be used to assign roles and permissions.

### Marketing description
As Akvo FLOW is often used by large organisations, it is very important that dashboard users have a way to organise their data collection projects in a flexible way. Therefore, we are introducing project folders, which provides an intuitive, hierarchical folder structure in which survey and monitoring projects can be stored. The interface closely reflects the usual way files are stored in folders on a computer. In addition, access for a particular user can be restricted to certain folders, providing a fine-grained level of access control. 


### Initial features
* The left sidebar acts like a horizontal sliding navigation, displaying project groups
* Users can navigate by clicking on a project group. This slides the list to the left, replacing it by the deeper level of groups. 
* For all but the root view, a 'back' button is shown, which the user can click to go back up one level in the navigation.
* Inside a project group there can either be further project groups, or projects.
