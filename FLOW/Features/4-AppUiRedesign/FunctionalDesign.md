FLOW App UI redesign
--------------------

### Overview
The aim is to create a new visual design for the FLOW App.

### Initial features
As its starting point, this project will take the Monitoring-feature enabled FLOW app, version 1.14.5 or higher.

### Non goals
We know that there are a number of features that we will add to the FLOW app in the near future, such as:
* User login 
* difference between enumerator / field manager
* additional statistics screens that help the workflow of enumerator / field manager.

These new functionalities will not yet be part of this redesign: the goal will be to first redesign the existing functionality.

### Technical notes
Part of this issue is to refactor the app in a way that allows the visual redesign to be implemented.
