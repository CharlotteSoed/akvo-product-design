# Functional Design document

Mobile users
-------------

### Overview
The aim is to introduce mobile users for FLOW app. Where we currently assign surveys to devices, the idea is that with this feature, a mobile user would log in in the FLOW app, and retrieve surveys assigned to him/her. In this way, data can be protected better, and there are less problems with identifying devices. Forms will be assigned to users instead of to devices.

### Marketing description
####Protect your data with FLOW mobile users
Many organisiations use FLOW for the collection of household data. Household data is sensitive, and should be protected as much as possible. That is why Akvo is introducing mobile users, who can log in to the FLOW app to gain access to forms and data specifically assigned to them. Multiple users can share a device, and each will only see the data and forms they should have access to. In this way, organisations can control who has access to what, giving them full freedom to create a workflow that protects sensitive information.


### Initial features
The initial list of functionalities that this feature will contain
* Introduce mobile users on the device. A user logs in using a 4-number numeric pincode
* On a single device, multiple users can be defined. A user only sees the forms and data that she has access to
* On the device, two types of users exist: mobile admin and mobile user
* The device admin can create new users directly on the device
* A user can register herself on the app, and send the information to the dashboard. There, the user request can be approved.
