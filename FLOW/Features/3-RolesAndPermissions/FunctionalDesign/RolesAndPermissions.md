### Overview

Roles and Permissions describe the different levels of an individual’s access on the Akvo FLOW dashboard.  The dashboard includes several tabs: surveys, devices, data, reports, maps, users, and messages.  Access to the information in these tabs is limited depending on an individual’s role and permission level, i.e., “user” versus “admin”.  For example, certain people are able to edit the contents of a survey while others are not.  Roles and Permissions restrict survey group based access as well.

### Marketing description

Use Roles and Permissions to keep order on the dashboard; protect data from being tampered with.  It doesn’t make sense for everyone in a given company/organization to share the same access to different sections of the dashboard.  A Project Manager needs to be able to access the surveys that are coming in from the field, while a User only must be able to upload data from the field.  Roles and Permissions provide structure within this hierarchy of access.

### Scenarios

Scenario 1:  You are a Regional Manager managing multiple country programs in East Africa.  The projects vary from public health issues to schools being built in rural regions.  It is your responsibility to oversee these different projects and thus you need access to data from multiple countries and multiple programs.  Your colleague who manages one malaria project in rural Kenya, however, does not need access to other programs in the region.  She can see data from a specific set of surveys disseminated in her region and pertaining to malaria only.

Scenario 2:  The local government in rural Columbia is concerned about access to water over the next several generations and is thus engaged in a project to map water points throughout the area.  They have given a small grant to an NGO using Akvo’s tools to take up the task.  The Project Manager builds the survey and has access to deleting and publishing them, while the Field Manager only has access to edit.

Scenario 3:  A small NGO has implemented a gender equality/economic development project, teaching women in northern India to start small businesses and be the breadwinners in their families.  The initiative has been so successful that the program model is being replicated in several additional regions.  A translator has been hired to translate surveys for this purpose.   The permission to have access to translations is then limited to the translator.

Scenario 4:  You are the Project Manager for a malaria-related program based in West Africa.  Your primary task is to manage a group of 50 enumerators.  First you need to make sure all everyone’s device is connected to the dashboard.  To do this, a bulk upload works best.  From inside the app, where you would normally see the option to set a User and Device ID, select “Bulk Upload.”  Visit the Devices tab on the dashboard to check if the device is listed.  If they are, you are all set to go.
