# RSR Programme structure

## Overview
We aim to build functionality into RSR that brings programmes online, allowing the visualisation of partner networks, financing, reporting, monitoring and collaboration.

We would of course ensure that the current functionality of RSR continues to operate within this new structure.

## Marketing description
Many organisations operate in collaborative structures with common goals. It is important for them to have a place for showing their partner network, management structure, work progress, budget flows and more. Moreover, they need to have useful tools for collaboration and paperless reporting.

An RSR Programme feature would enable Akvo users to add, change and retrieve higher-level programme information. Besides that it will keep everyone in the network informed obout progress made.


## Initial features
The initial list of functionalities that this feature could contain:

###Programme information###
Containing:

* Programme description
* Objectives
* Partner organisations
* Focus area(s)
* Projects
* Updates
* FLOW data
* Financing structure (IATI Standard)
* Locations
* Contact information

###Collaboration tools###
With the purpuse to:

* Initiate, create and develop projects
* Invite partners to collaborate
* Arrange funding
* Get approval for project execution

###Paperless reporting###
With the purpose to:

* Create reporting requirements for projects
* Providing, adding and removing user permissions for partners working on projects
* Submit work to lower-level or higher-level operations
* See what information is missing on projects and needs improvement
* Track budget and funding information over time
* Monitor and evaluate KPIs
* Report notifications to users working on projects

## Non goals
We will not replace Akvo Sites or Akvo Pages

## Scenarios
**Scenario 1 - Programme managers**
A programme manager provides Akvo with the details needed to set up the programme information page. In MyAkvo the programme manager is able to add, change and remove partners, projects and user roles. Moreover the programme manager can create reporting requirements, trackers and reminders.

**Scenario 2 - Member organisations**
Organisations working within the programme have their projects made visible within the programme structure and can collaborate and report accordingly.

**Scenario 3 - Organisation users**
The users of programme member organisations are able to login to their admin interface to collaborate on projects, update and report.

**Scenario 4 - Akvo users**
Users of Akvo.org would like to be able to see some of the multilateral programmes that Akvo partners are working on.

**Scenario 5 - Akvo**
Akvo needs to have its own portal to visualise all programmes within RSR.

## User Experience 
Users should be able to navigate to this feature from Akvo.org to find programmes within RSR.

Programme members should be able to navigate to this feature via MyAkvo and receive notifications.

Users should be able to utilise any existing links to projects, updates or organisations to access content.

## Technical notes
We should make this feature OpenSource and available for the public to download and use.

We should determine what (admin) interface is needed to provide all the necessary functionality.
