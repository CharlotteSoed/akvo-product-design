# RSR Header and Footer

A common user complaint is that it is not clear what users can do and what they should do once they arrive on the site.

As the current header and navigation within RSR is shared with the Akvo.org website and does not clearly represent the fact that RSR is its own product and needs its own set of navigation points for users.

## User problems
1. Users are exposed to too much information and its not clear what they should be doing.

## User stories
5. Klaus can find the information he are looking for.

## Optional
The Header and Footer should be optional additions to Akvo Pages that allow Admins to include to exclude this from their instance as required to fit in with their own website navigational needs.

## Header

We should have an optional header that is displayed on Akvo Pages that has the following main tabs:

- Projects
- Updates
- Organisations

The header should display clearly a button for:

- Add Update

The header should display clearly membership options of:

- Register
- Sign in

If logged in the Header should display:

- Notification area
- MyRSR
- Sign out

### Projects

Should direct the user to a project listing page showing all projects within the Akvo Page.

### Updates

Should direct the user to an update listing page showing all project updates on projects within the Akvo Page.

### Organisations

Should direct the user to an organisation listing page showing all organisations linked to projects within the Akvo Page.

### Add Update

Should direct the user to sign in if they are not already signed in.
The user should then be directed to their list of projects within the MyRSR section showing all the projects that they have the permissions to update.

## Footer

We should have an optional footer that is displayed on Akvo Pages that has the following main tabs:
