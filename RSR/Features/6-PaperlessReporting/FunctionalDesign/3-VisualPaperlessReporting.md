# Visual Design

### Overview
It is likely that the end result of this feature will result in many different modules being made available that are build on an existing set of data.

I have developed already 2 different mockups / prototypes for this solution that have been presented to potential partners with greatb enthusiasm, so these will form the basis of the soluiton we should be working on that fills the MVP for this feature.

Draft Mockup:
