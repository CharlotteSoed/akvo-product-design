# Searching and Filtering
The searching and filtering options within RSR need to be considered for the entire platform.

Project, Update and Organisation listing pages would make use of this feature in similar ways with different fields forming the basis of the search index.

Auto-completion of search terms would be desirable, but we would need to determine what words/strings can be used to populate the completion process.

## User problems
1. Users cannot find projects and organisations easily.

## User stories
5. Klaus can find the information he is looking for.
