# RSR Listing Pages
RSR needs a standard view for displaying lists of projects, updates and organisations.

## User problems
4. Users cannot find projects and organisations easily.

## User stories
5. Klaus can find the information he are looking for.

## Dependencies
This feature includes a **Search and Filtering** feature that is critical to its effectiveness as a set of pages. Due to the complex nature of this feature, it will be covered in a separate issue.

## Structure

Each page will display the following elements:

- Map showing all locations for all assets in the list
