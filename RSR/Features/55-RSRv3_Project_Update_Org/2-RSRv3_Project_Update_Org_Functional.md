# RSR Project, Update and Organisation Pages
The standard view of projects, updates and organisations has remained stagnant within RSR for some time. The existing visual design while functionally providing a clear overview, is missing in current trends and features present in modern day web applications.

We have recently implemented a larger data set in RSR that has been derived from the IATI standard. This new information needs to be displayed within the visual display of RSR on Akvo Pages.

## User problems
7. Users need to be able to easily share visual information about their projects.
10. Users need to be able to find the relevant info on project and organisation pages.
11. Users need clear visual overview of project information.
15. Users need to update projects as simply as possible.

## User stories
4. Sandra and Preethi can see all of the important and available actions that they can perform.
6. Sandra can communicate with other users about projects.
7. Klaus can get a high level overview of a project from a single page.
8. Matthijs can gain access to a detailed view of all project data.
9. Sandra can see activity on a project over time.
