Akvo RSR
===================

In order to facilitate the development and expansion of Akvo RSR, we have created a range of documentation and supporting materials that help to guide and direct the feature and functionality improvements to meet the needs and requirements of our users.

## Personas

We have developed a series of user personas that capture the different user types we have in place. Each of these personas is based on one or more actual users of RSR, and attempt to cover the entire spectrum of potential users that wish to interact with the platform.

## Red Routes

Based on methodology created for designing public transportation networks in large cities, the red routes idea comes from defining all the features and functionalityb within a product or service and identifying their frequency and scope within the user base to give an indication of impact in relation to other features. The core of this means the redder a feature is, the more vital it is to the product and so a bigger focus should be spent refnining and improving this than other features.

## Feature Mapping

Following on from the Red Routes work, we have taken each of the features and placed these into a Trello board. This activity has also enabled a numbering convention to be applied to RSR features, giving a standard reference point for ongoing development and improvements.

## User Stories

Now that all the features have been nicely divided up into manageable chunks, we can start to see how users could interact with each of these and what their requirements for each of these items is. To visualise this information, we have another trello board with a column for each feature and a card per user story.

Additionally, all user stories have 1 or 2 personas attached to them that indicate the primary and secondary personas for the feature. These personas are the ones that should be referred to when scoping the feature, and new developments should be tested against these personas.
