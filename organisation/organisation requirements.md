Overview
========

This document describes what we call Akvo's organisation requirements. These requirements describe the core thoughts and principles around which Akvo Foundation was created, how it is operated on a daily basis, and the rational behind it. Not only is it a non-trivial task to write fundamental requirements down, the requirements constantly change, so this document will never be "finished".

This document has both organisational and technical requirements listed, as we believe some of the organisational requirements drive technical requirements, even if not all do. However, it would feel disjointed to list only those that do drive technical requirements, or the other way around, so we list all of them here.

Akvo does not have a public "vision and mission", but it is quite a good way of describing what we do, so we use it here anyway.

Organisational requirements
===========================


1. A functional business model
------------------------------
**Requirement**: Akvo needs a functional business model which primarily is based on organisations paying for the use of the internet services which we operate.

**Implementation**: We have chosen internet services which are paid for by the Accountable organisations which use them. (See Trusted partner network below.)

**Rationale**: Akvo should not be dependent on grants for its work, as grants are hard to get reliably over a longer period of time. We also believe that paying for services which you use raises the appreciation for what you get as well as enable you to make an informed decision whether the cost for the service is appropriate. If it is hidden in grants which are paid indirectly then this decision is harder.


2. Trusted partner network
--------------------------
**Requirement**: Partners using Akvo's tools should be trusted.

**Implementation**: Akvo has a tiered partner network. To be a partner which can bring in other partners to be part of the network you have to be classified as an Accountable partner (previuosly Support partner). Accountable partners go through a screening process. 

**Rationale**: The concept of a Trusted Partner Network exists within the Akvo network of partners. The idea is that you should be able to trust that a particular partner does a good job in implementing projects in their area of specialisation. Organisations and individuals come to Akvo to ask for advice on where to invest money or grant money to projects, or evaluate data that the partner has entered into our systems. They rely on our or our Accontable partners judgment that a partner can be trusted to do a good job.

**Comment**: The Akvo Accountable partners go through a process to become an accountable partner. The criteria, the tasks and responsibilities of a typical accountable partner and the process of becoming an accountable parter is documented here: http://www.akvo.org/web/partner_rules (Note that this currently on reflects Akvo RSR Accountable partners. It is needs to be updated for FLOW.)

3. Open source production
-------------------------
**Requirement**: Akvo's work needs to be shared. Akvo's work should not be used by others without sharing back. 

**Implementation**: The tools and systems Akvo builds are openly available in a way that enforces sharing. Software is shared under the Affero General Public License. Documentation and other content is shared under the Creative Commons Attibution, Share Alike, Non-commercial license (CC-BY-SA-NC), the CC-BY or CC-BY-SA license. For a more detailed discussion, please read: http://akvo.org/blog/open-data-content-and-software-at-akvo/

**Rationale**: The key reasons our work should be shared are:

- to avoid the lock-in effect for our partners, to ensure that our partners don't get stranded with proprietary systems
- to promote sharing of systems development among organisations and countries which could save money on shared systems development
- to promote open systems (open source, open content, open APIs), which we believe embodies better democracy
